# 📱 UpcycleX – Smart E-Waste Upcycling Assistant

**By EcoBurn Tech**

UpcycleX is a mobile-first AI-powered application that empowers informal recyclers, youth innovators, and sustainability champions across Africa to safely upcycle electronic waste and generate clean energy through connected EcoBurn micro-incinerators.

---

## 🌍 Purpose

Africa generates over **2.9 million tons of e-waste** annually, with much of it burned openly or dumped, causing severe environmental and health hazards. Simultaneously, **over 600 million Africans lack reliable electricity**.

**UpcycleX** solves both challenges by:
- Helping users **identify, disassemble, and repurpose** electronics via an AI-guided mobile app.
- Routing non-recyclable/hazardous parts to **EcoBurn smart incinerators**, which generate clean energy safely.
